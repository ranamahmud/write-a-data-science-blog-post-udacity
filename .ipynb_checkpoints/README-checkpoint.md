## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

I was interested to analyze this data set to find out what set apart the happily married and divorced couples. In this project I tried to answer the following questions using Divorce Predictors data:

1. Is there a significant difference between Happily Married and Divorced couples?
2. What are the most agreed and disagreed things between the couples?
3. What couples need to focus most to prevent divorce?
4. How accurately we can predict a future divorce?
